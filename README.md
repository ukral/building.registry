# building.registry

The building registry of Vienna in the late 1920s was knowledge base for real estate and finance business. At this time, the registry was published on paper. The  [Wienbibliothek im Rathaus](www.wienbibliothek.at) scanned the documents and distribute the [Häuser-Kataster der Bundeshauptstadt Wien](permalink.obvsg.at/wbr/AC07637508) online in PDF format. We converted the PDFs into a machine-readable format.

This repository includes:

* [Dataset](Dataset.csv): The CSV file inlcudes the data records.
* [Codebook](Codebook.md): The markdown file specifies the dataset format, the data fields and comments the data fields to faciliate the use of the data records.


It is noted that the dataset includes seven attributes from the [Häuser-Kataster der Bundeshauptstadt Wien](permalink.obvsg.at/wbr/AC07637508) (street name, building number, position in a row of buildings, property area, number of floors, year of construction, year of purchase) as well as supplementary attributes (urban district in 1920s, urban district in 2010s, street name in 2010s, building number in 2010s, and two types of page numbers from the PDF files). The supplementary attributes help to use the data, as for instance, to geotagg the historical data records or to analyse the data records.
